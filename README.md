# Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus.Compression
Compress and Decompress Azure Servicebus messages with ease.

### This is a library based on [Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus/) 

This library supportors optional compression of Servicebus messages if the size of the body is larger than a defined Threshold.

This can be helpfull when using the standard servicebus where the message cannot be greater then 256Kb.

The library borrows a lot from [ServiceBus.CompressionPlugin](https://github.com/SeanFeldman/ServiceBus.CompressionPlugin)
